# Binary-Search-Tree
This python script contains the construction and testing of a binary search tree data structure. The BST is constructed in the upper-half of the program, and then methods are written which test the components of the BST in the lower-half of the code. An example of such methods is one that compares the shape of one BST object to another, returning true if each data set has the exact same number and orientation of branches.
